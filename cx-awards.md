# CX Awards North America 2020

### How do I apply for an award?

- Your company is based in North America
- You’ve worked with Clarabridge in 2019
- Please click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek2purGGNSGsTcee0srKeWwcIhrgAy43p-StmwJS5mCgm9bw/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to submit an application 

- You will be prompted to select an award category that you want to enter (we have four) and you are welcome to apply for more than one award!  

- The application form should take you no more than 20 to 30 minutes to complete; bullet point responses are fine! Reach out to your Clarabridge Account Manager or email [events@clarabridge.com](mailto:events@clarabridge.com) if you’d like additional help; we are more than happy to help write the application responses with you. 

- You must apply for an award by **5:00 PM EST on Friday, March 6th**

### When will CX award winners be announced? 

- Award winners will be notified prior to C3 2020 and they will be announced on stage at the Hard Rock Hotel San Diego during our CX awards ceremony. 

- Winners will receive two free passes to attend our C3 2021 event. In addition, they will be given a CX Award Winner logo to display on their website and social media pages. 

Winning an award will carry some major clout for your business, and for you as a professional. You know you’re a CX star and this is your chance to shout it out to the world: you love your customers!
