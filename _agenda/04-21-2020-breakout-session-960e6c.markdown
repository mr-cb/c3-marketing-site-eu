Some customers scream louder than others and, while we want to react to every customer as quickly as possible, it is imperative that we have a system to understand potential impact and triage feedback accordingly. This session will connect the dots between several signature Clarabridge features to demonstrate how you can understand drivers of specific outcomes, score future records to reflect related risk and prioritize customer engagements in a consistent way.
