Please join us to hear about the latest industry trends and best practices for operationalizing omni-channel customer feedback. We will facilitate roundtable discussions for several industries including healthcare/insurance, finance/banking, consumer packaged goods, retail, travel, and more. There will also be a few roundtable discussions that are not industry specific.

Key takeaways from this session will include:
· Latest industry trends and best practices based on analyst and other third-party insights, client successes, and proven Clarabridge frameworks
· Interactive discussions with peers in similar industries on topics such as strategic focus areas, common use cases, operational reporting, actions taken based on VOC insights, and outcomes / value achieved
· Sharing examples with your peers of activities and programs leading to stakeholder education of customer experience management, adoption of customer insights, and ownership of improvement initiatives

This workshop is open for all attendees to register; however, space is limited, and you must be registered for this workshop to attend.
